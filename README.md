This mod greatly simplifies the process of donating gear for troop experience.

It modifies only two things: The 'transfer all' button, and the function that controls the display of donated experience at the bottom of the inventory screen.

In addition to displaying how much experience you've currently donated, you can also see the maximum donatable exp.

When using 'transfer all,' the worth of each transferred item is tracked. Once the donatable exp is maxed out, the transfer of donatable items stops.

Items that are not worth experience will still get dropped. When combined with inventory locks, this is a good way to quickly dump off things that you know you don't need, while also getting whatever experience you might currently need.

Transfer All can be activated a second time to go ahead and drop everything, even if it's way over the maximum exp.

The mod respects item locks and filters. It can also be a great way to keep your inventory tidy - sort by ascending # of items and it will prioritize donating all those really small stacks you end up with that can end up lagging your inventory.

When combined with a mod like Party Screen Enhancements Redux that allows for automated troop upgrade, you can raise an army of max-tier troops in just seconds with zero waste: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/6237
